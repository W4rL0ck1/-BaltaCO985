# Resolution
This issue I found to be some mismatch on framework packages when I recently upgraded the Angular CLI to Angular 9. This error could also be producible due to other reasons.

After initial trivial, I was able to resolve the issue by following below steps and series of commands,

# Ideally below commands should fix this error but in case if the issue still persists please try using other below commands.

npm install --save-dev @angular-devkit/build-angular

# If the above commands don’t fix the issue, please try the below steps.

Delete node_module folder manually from local project directory
npm rm -rf node_modules

Delete package-lock.json file. (Don’t worry next npm install anyway will create a fresh package-lock.json file.)
package-lock.json

Clean NPM cache
npm cache clean --force
